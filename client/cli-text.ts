===========================
   TERMINAL LAN CHAT
===========================

💡 HOW IT WORKS:
- Type anything to send a message.
- Messages are shared with everyone on the LAN.
- Commands start with a slash (/).

🛠️ COMMANDS:
/party     → Show users in the room.
/history   → Show message history again.
/clear     → Clear the terminal screen.
/exit      → Leave the chat silently.
/Abandon   → Leave and notify others. (REALLY? Nah, is not working :D)

/help      → Show this helper message again.
